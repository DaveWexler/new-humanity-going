This is going to be a grand redesign of my current blog site, humanitygoing.com.

It is currently a blog about science development and society with commentary, but I would like to add film reviews and commentary to the site, as well as possibly a page for general commentary on anything I feel like putting up there.

Pages:
Science News
Film Reviews
Film Commentary
Stuff from my Brain
